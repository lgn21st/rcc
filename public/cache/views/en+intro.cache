<h3>How will the meeting goes?</h3>
<p>
shanghaionrails is a non-profit tech group so we plan to make this event public and free. but get some money from sponsors for the fee. Javaeye is a most active developer community here in china.
<br />
We make the meeting because we get a chance to invite Matz to come. So we decided to take this opportunity to promote ruby in china and push the community forward.
<br />
We are plan to receive about 200+ guys. we  will promote this meeting on media both china and japan.
